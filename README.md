# Fritz Box Device Tracker for Home Assistant
This is an integration of a device tracker based on a fritzbox router.

It is a subset of the core integration "FritzBox tools" with much less functionality, just the tracker.
It works without a privilege access to the fritzbox. Meant for who doesn't want to offer to Home Assistant 
privileged access to the router.
Indeed, this integration does not need any user definition at all on the fritzbox.

## Installation
add the repository to HACS.
